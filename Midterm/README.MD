# Midterm Project

Render a wheel rotating along a roadway. 
The scene should include a roadway scenery and the background of a field or forest that moves with the wheel. 
The wheel should stay in the middle of the scene with everything else moving. 
The wheel should be decorated with 4 spokes with a measurable width.
